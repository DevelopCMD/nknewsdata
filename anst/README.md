# ANST - nikernOS News Technology
ANST is a news system for the upcoming nikernOS. 
All the info used to decode ANST news is in a file called **anstbundle.nkgz**.
<br/>Here's how you can make your own:

Before you make your own ANST news, here are the contents of a anstbundle.nkgz file:
- bg.svg = background
- slide1.svg and slide2.svg = slides shown on the news
- ct.nk = how long each slide stays for, usually contains only one number
- ~nstbundlemaker = generated by the anst tools, contains a dc.nk file used for storing the date.

To make your own ANST news, please use the template provided.
